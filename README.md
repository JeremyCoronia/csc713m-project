# MBTI Type Prediction
We perform both binary classification (e.g., I vs. E) and multi-class labeling (using the 16 4-letter MBTI types) to perform MBTI personality type prediction using online posts.

We also perform a data augmentation technique called SMOTE to better represent the least represented classes we've gleaned from our EDA. To perform classification, we used XGB, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Multinomial Naive Bayes. The F-score and accuracy scores were calculated to compare model performances.
